# dev — working on ppm

Install this package when you are changing ppm itself rather than using it. It adds commands for
testing installs on machines you can throw away, and wires up the git hooks that version packages.

```bash
ppm install ppm/dev
```

Run `ppm container`, `ppm user` or `ppm hooks` for their usage. What follows is what each one is
for and when to reach for it.

## Three Ways to Test an Install

ppm's riskiest code is the part that runs once, on a machine that has nothing: prerequisites,
Homebrew, the first stow. That is exactly the code you cannot test on your own workstation, because
your workstation is already set up. So this package offers three kinds of throwaway machine, and
the differences between them are the whole point:

| | Isolation | Cost | Reaches |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ppm user` | a second user on **your** machine | seconds | user-level install, a second user against your Homebrew |
| `ppm container` | a Debian or Fedora container | seconds | everything except the kernel and the session |
| macOS VM *(not built yet)* | a full macOS guest | ~14s from a snapshot | everything, including login shells |

**`ppm user`** creates a throwaway user, runs the installer as them and logs you in. It is the
cheapest way to see what a *second* user experiences — the non-owner Homebrew path in particular —
but it shares your machine, so it proves nothing about a bare one.

**`ppm container`** is the workhorse. It builds a Debian or Fedora image with two test users
(`owner`, who has sudo with a password, and `other`, who has none) and mounts your source repos
read-only at `/src`, so the container tests your **working tree** — edits show up without
committing. Snapshots make the expensive part reusable: install Homebrew once, snapshot, and every
later run starts from there in seconds. It needs podman (`ppm install podman`).

What containers cannot reach is the reason the third row exists: no systemd services, no login
sessions (so nothing that `chsh` touches, and no rc files being sourced for real), no kernel
features like NFS or KVM. And nothing on that list covers macOS at all, which is where ppm's most
fragile paths live — Xcode Command Line Tools, the Homebrew prefix, `sysadminctl`, `/etc/shells`.

## macOS Testing

Not built yet. A spike has proven it works — a `tart` VM on Apple Silicon, provisioned with the
same two test users, the same read-only `/src` mounts, a cold `install.sh` in about three minutes
and a reset from snapshot in fourteen seconds — and settled the design questions. The findings and
the spike scripts are in `chorus/units/testing/01-macos-vm/`.

The intended shape is `ppm vm`, a sibling of `ppm container` with the same subcommands, so that
testing a change on macOS is the same motion as testing it on Debian.

## Git Hooks

`ppm hooks` points a repo's `core.hooksPath` at the hooks this package stows, which bump a
package's patch version whenever a commit touches it.

This is an install step rather than repo content because **git does not carry hooks through a
clone** — a hook committed to a repository does nothing for whoever clones it. So the hook files
ship in a package, get stowed once, and each repo is pointed at the stowed copy. Editing a hook
then takes effect everywhere at once, and a higher-priority repo can override a single hook file
through the same stow layering as any other file.

The setting is always written per repo, never globally. A global `core.hooksPath` applies to every
repository on the machine *and* suppresses each one's own `.git/hooks`, which would silently
disable husky, lefthook or overcommit in unrelated projects.

The version bump happens **once per unpushed series**: the hook compares the working version
against the version at the push base, and only bumps when they match. A run of commits before one
push bumps once, `--amend` does not bump again, and a version you set by hand is left alone. A repo
with nothing pushed yet gets no bumps at all, so a new package sits at `0.1.0` until its first
push.

Because hooks are wired per repo, `ppm hooks install` has to be re-run after `ppm src add` — this
package's install hook cannot know about a repo you add later.
